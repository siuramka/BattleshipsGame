Two boards on the screen. Board1 is yours, Board2 is the opponents board.

# Players ships get randomly generated or player selects the positions them himself?

There are multiple ship types:

- Boss Class [3x2] x2
- Destroyer Class [4x1] x2
- Boat Class [2x1] x2 
- LifeJacket Class [1x1] x3

Rules 

Can't place/generate ships near one another - there must be a 1x1 space between every position of the ship.
